# ner-annotator
A simple CLI annotator for hand-annotated named entities. Saves results in StanfordNLP and spaCy formats.


## Use
From the ner-annotator directory, run:
```
python3 annotate.py path/to/file.txt path/to/output/directory/
```
The annotator appears to also work on Python 2.7, though this has not been tested extensively. Use Python 3 for best results.
